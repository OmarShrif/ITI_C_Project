--------------- Clinic Management System | ITI-C Project ---------------

Developed a C code for a clinic management system that 
allows two modes of operation: admin and user.

  o Admin mode: requires a password and provides 
    features such as adding, editing, reserving, and 
    canceling patient records.    
    << Defult Password : 1234 >>
    
  o User mode: provides features such as viewing patient 
    records and today's reservations
    
The system also manages the available slots for the doctor and ensures that the patient IDs are unique.
